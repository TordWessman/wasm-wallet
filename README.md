POC crypto wallet made in Rust and intended to be used as a WASM module.\ 
My first Rust project and only intended as a mean for me to teach myself Rust.\ 

***DO NOT USE*** At best it can be useful as an inspiration.

Compile using (no optimization)
```$ wasm-pack build --target web```

Run
```$ python3 -m http.server 8765```
and browse to `localhost:8765`.
